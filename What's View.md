# What is View?

In SQL, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. Unlike a physical table, a view doesn't store data itself but rather provides a way to represent the result of a query as if it were a table. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, encapsulate business logic, and restrict access to specific columns or rows.

**Creating a View in SQL:**
To create a view in SQL, you can use the CREATE VIEW statement followed by a SELECT query that defines the structure and data to be included in the view.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Creating a view to display information about high-value customers
CREATE VIEW HighValueCustomers AS
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    TotalPurchases
FROM Customers
WHERE TotalPurchases > 1000;
```

In this example:
- `HighValueCustomers` is the name of the view.
- The SELECT statement defines the structure of the view and the criteria for selecting data.
- The view includes only the specified columns (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, TotalPurchases) and rows where TotalPurchases exceed 1000.

Once a view is created, it can be queried like a regular table:

```sql
-- Querying the view
SELECT * FROM HighValueCustomers;
```

Views provide a layer of abstraction, allowing users to interact with the data in a more structured and controlled manner without directly accessing the underlying tables. They are particularly useful for simplifying complex queries, enforcing security, and promoting a modular approach to database design.
