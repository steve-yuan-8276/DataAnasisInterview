# The difference of where and having

Both WHERE and HAVING can be used to filter tables. The two are reflected when used together with the GROUP BY clause. The WHERE clause will filter rows before GROUP (before the GROUP BY clause), and HAVING will filter after GROUP.

WHERE和HAVING都可以用于表的筛选。而两者分别在与GROUP BY子句一起使用时体现，WHERE子句会在GROUP之前筛选行(在GROUP BY子句之前)，HAVING会在GROUP之后筛选。
