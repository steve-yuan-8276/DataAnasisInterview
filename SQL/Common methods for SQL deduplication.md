# Common methods for SQL deduplication

In SQL, there are several main methods for deduplication:

1. **Using the DISTINCT Keyword:**
   Using the `DISTINCT` keyword allows you to filter unique records from the result set, effectively removing duplicates.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
   FROM your_table;
   ```

   This will return the unique values for the specified columns.

2. **Using GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions:**
   Combining the `GROUP BY` clause with aggregate functions allows you to group and deduplicate records. This is useful when you need to aggregate other columns.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2, MAX(aggregated_column)
   FROM your_table
   GROUP BY column1, column2;
   ```

   In this example, `MAX(aggregated_column)` can be any aggregate function, such as `MIN()` or `AVG()`.

3. **Using Window Functions for Deduplication:**
   Leveraging window functions, especially `ROW_NUMBER()`, allows you to assign row numbers to each group and then select records with row number 1. This is beneficial for deduplication within groups.

   ```sql
   WITH DeduplicatedData AS (
       SELECT
           column1,
           column2,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2 ORDER BY some_ordering_column) AS RowNum
       FROM your_table
   )

   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM DeduplicatedData
   WHERE RowNum = 1;
   ```

   In this example, the `PARTITION BY` clause specifies the columns for grouping, and `some_ordering_column` is used to define the order of row numbers.

**Notes:**
The choice of method depends on specific requirements and data structure. If you simply need unique values, using `DISTINCT` is the most straightforward. If you need to perform other aggregations alongside deduplication, consider using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. For more complex deduplication needs, such as deduplication based on specific columns, window functions may offer greater flexibility.
