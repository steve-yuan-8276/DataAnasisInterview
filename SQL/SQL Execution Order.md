# SQL Execution Order

In SQL, when considering the execution order with window functions, it generally follows these steps:

1. FROM Clause: Data is retrieved from the tables specified in the FROM clause

2. WHERE Clause: Filtering is applied based on the conditions specified in the WHERE clause.

3. GROUP BY Clause: If present, data is grouped according to the columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.

4. HAVING Clause: If there is a HAVING clause, it filters the grouped data further.

5. SELECT Clause: Non-window function expressions in the SELECT clause are computed.

6. WINDOW Clause: If a WINDOW clause is present, it defines the window specification for window functions.

7. Window Function Calculation: Window functions are computed based on the specified window specifications.

8. ORDER BY Clause: If an ORDER BY clause is present, the results may be sorted accordingly.

9. LIMIT/OFFSET Clauses: If LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used, they are applied to limit the result set.

**Notes:**
It's important to note that not all queries will involve all these steps, and the specific execution order can vary based on the query structure. Window function calculations typically occur in the later stages as they depend on the data subsets (windows) created in previous steps.
