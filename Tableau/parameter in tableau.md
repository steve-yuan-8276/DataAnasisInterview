What is a parameter in tableau and what are some examples of how you have utilized it?

In Tableau, a parameter is a dynamic input that allows users to replace a constant value in a calculation, filter, or reference line. Parameter also can be combined with Dashboard action for flexible application, which is one of the advanced applications of Tableau Desktop.

Examples of Parameter Usage and How I've Utilized Parameters:

    - Changing Measures or Dimensions:Parameters can be employed to enable users to switch between different measures or dimensions dynamically.

    - Dynamic Filters:You can use parameters to create dynamic filters that allow users to choose a specific dimension or measure dynamically. For example, you could create a parameter that allows users to switch between different date ranges, regions, or categories.

    - Custom Aggregations:Parameters can be used to create custom aggregations or calculations that users can modify on the fly. For example, users might want to switch between displaying total sales, average sales, or some other measure using a parameter.

    - Top N Analysis:Parameters can be employed to allow users to dynamically choose the "Top N" items in a visualization. This is useful for focusing on the most significant data points in a given context.

    - Swapping Sheets:Parameters can be utilized to create sheet swapping, where users can switch between different sheets or dashboards using a parameter-driven selection.

In essence, parameters in Tableau provide a powerful mechanism for adding interactivity and flexibility to dashboards, allowing users to explore data in a more dynamic and customized way.
